# Base Rule

* **Response Language:** `zh-TW`
* All specifications, plans, and user-facing documentation MUST be written in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW), ONLY constitution MUST in English.
* When drafting the constitution, the context MUST be translated into "constitution_zhTW.md" and placed in the same directory (please note that file names are case-sensitive).
* Git Log, Code annotations MUST be written in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW).

# Development Guidelines

* When the frontend calls a backend API or function, ensure that the API or function actually exists on the backend. Do not arbitrarily name or assume APIs/functions.

* Avoid over-design and over-engineering.

* During development, the frontend UI should take layout height into account. Input fields, components, and their placement should be consistent across the interface.

# virtual environment:
  * Check whether a virtual environment (e.g., .ven) exists in the current folder. If it does, do not create a virtual environment.
