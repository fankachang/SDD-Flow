# Base Rules

* **Response Language:** `zh-TW`
* All specifications, plans, and user-facing documentation MUST be written in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW). Only the constitution MUST be in English.
* When drafting the constitution, the context MUST be translated into `constitution_zhTW.md` and placed in the same directory (file names are case-sensitive).
* Git logs and code annotations MUST be written in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW).

## Development Guidelines

* When the frontend calls a backend API or function, ensure the API/function actually exists on the backend. Do not arbitrarily name or assume APIs/functions.
* Avoid over-design and over-engineering.
* During development, the frontend UI should account for layout height. Input fields, components, and their placement should be consistent across the interface.

## Virtual Environment

* Check whether a virtual environment (e.g., `.venv`) exists in the current folder. If it does, do not create a new virtual environment.

## Skills

Skills in this project are stored as folders under `.agents/skills/`. Each skill has a fixed entry file named `SKILL.md`.

* **How to reference / find skills**
  * Open directly: `.agents/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`
  * VS Code global search: search for `path:.agents/skills SKILL.md`, or search by skill-id (e.g. `python-venv-check`)
  * Browse the directory: open `.agents/skills/` to see the list of available skills

* **Included skills (folder name = skill-id)**

## Agent

* If you have questions, use #askQuestions and provide your proposed solutions for the user to choose from.
* If the specification is not clearly defined, default to using TDD for planning and development.
